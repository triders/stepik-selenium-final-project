<h1> Nice to see you, stranger!</h1>
This is the final project from "Python+Se Automation" course https://stepik.org/course/575/syllabus. 

<h3> I learn Python and this is one of my first Python projects </h3>
in case you notice some code style imperfections or other insights, please let me know.

<h3> Hint: you can run tests in 'headless' mode (without browser windows) </h3>
Just add <code>--headless=true</code> in the terminal, for example:

<code>pytest --headless=true -v --tb=line --language=en -m need_review</code> 

<h3>P.S. Sometimes the testing site crashes (you may have already noticed), returning a Server errors. Please ru-run tests in this case: give them another chance, they are not guilty :-)</h3>
